# Android_ADB_UI

This tools was created to skip the adb installation commands everytime to 
view installed packages / install / uninstall packages.
This was a personal utility and learning project created with python3 sanic framework, JS, angular.

Just downloading the folder and running sanicapp.py can initiate a local web server with UI 
This can be viewed in browser with localhost:8080

Notes:

1. This can be used only with Android debug bridge
2. It internally uses ADB commands on your local machine.
   so make sure u have ADB installed and you can access adb commands in terminal
3. The mobile device / emulator should be connected and accessible
